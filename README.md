# CustomerRelationsManagementAPP:

This is an android application that manages one's contact information. The project is built using React-Native. The project can also be converted to an ios application by making some slight changes to the components of the application.

The backend of the project is made using Node.js and express.

How to run:
# Backend: 
Open your terminal and hit command "npm install" and then type "npm start". This installs all the packages used in the project, and starts the application. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running before starting the backend application.

# Frontend: 
Type "react-native run-andorid" to start the application. Make sure you have all the react-native packages as well as android studio(along with emulator or physical device) installed and set up before starting the application.
